Outlook Add in that checks the recipients of emails you sent and alert you if you are sending email to multiple email domains. 
This is useful for instance if you are an account management role and accidentally adding the wrong email is a big issue
It will ignore your own domain as you most likely copy people from your own domain on a regular basis. You have the option to have the add in remember your selection and send (so as not to ask again in the future)

Tested on Outlook / Office 365 installed on Windows 10 when integrating MAPI emails
