# Domain_Checker_for_Outlook
2022
Outlook Add in that checks the recipients of emails you sent and alert you if you are sending email to multiple email domains. 
This is useful for instance if you are an account management role and accidentally adding the wrong email is a big issue
It will ignore your own domain as you most likely copy people from your own domain on a regular basis. You have the option to have the add in remember your selection and send (so as not to ask again in the future)

Tested on Outlook / Office 365 installed on Windows 10 when integrating MAPI emails

To install download Domain Checker Installer.zip and unzip on your computer. Then open folder and run setup. If properly installed, outlook will show an "Add-Ins" tab in the ribbon.
